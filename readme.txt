Completed an off-platform Codecademy project with a focus on debugging and fixing some broken code for a fictional page called 'Fotomatic'. 

The aim was to make the project look and work exactly as the specs given (included in root folder). 

I managed to get it to look pretty similar but there were a couple of minor issues regarding break points that could be improved if revisiting this in the future.
